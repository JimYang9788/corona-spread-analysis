# pandemic-exploration
As I am so bored working from home and wish to go back to school as soon
as possible, I created this side project that explores the covid-19 dataset
from Kaggle.

Some Goals:
- Forecast peak infected amount of people (aka how bad this will be)
- Analyze the rate of increase vs the same day stock price (aka if I can profit some money to pay my tuition)
- Forecast when the virus will end (aka when I can finally be back to school)# corona-spread-analysis
